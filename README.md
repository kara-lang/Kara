# Kara

An experimental functional programming language with dependent types, inspired by [Swift](https://swift.org) and [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org).

Kara is at a very early stage and is not available for general or limited use at this moment. The project currently contains only a basic
parser, type checker, interpreter, and JavaScript codegen. Documentation is sparse and most of the features are still in flux.

Star and watch the repository if you're interested in imminent updates.

If you'd like to contribute, please make sure you have a general understanding of Idris and ideally have read at least foundational parts
of [Type-Driven Development with Idris](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris) book, which inspire
development of Kara. This is not a hard requirement for working on the Kara compiler, but it would be very helpful for all contributors to
be on the same page with the general approach to designing the language.
